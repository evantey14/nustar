    "The goal of these notebooks is to create a 2D model of the potential figure seen at 40-50 keV near the galactic center. Ultimately, we want to learn more about what this object is and how it interacts with nearby sources."

    "# Method\n",
    "Creating 2D models can't be easily simplified to an automated procedure because of the scientific thought process that must go into each fit (e.g. deciding *what* we are trying to fit and *how*). The notebooks and scripts in this folder are tools to assist in the process of creating these fits. Generally I've used them in this order:\n",
    "* Create and save a background model with [background_component_model.ipynb](background_component_model.ipynb)\n",
    "* Create and save simple single-gaussian models with [single_gaussian_component_model.ipynb](single_gaussian_component_model.ipynb).\n",
    "* Considering the residuals, create more sophisticated models (using these created components) in [combined_model.ipynb](combined_model.ipynb) until the residuals are sufficiently accounted for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks run sherpa a bit slower than native python, so I've used a couple python scripts to speed up the especially long throughput procedures (e.g. [calculate_confidence.py](calculate_confidency.py))\n",
    "\n",
    "It's extremely important to have a good tracking system for the different components, sessions, and results, that are saved along the way so they don't get confounded. I personally wrote an external log in a google document."
